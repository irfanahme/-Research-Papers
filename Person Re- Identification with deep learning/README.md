# Person Re- Identification with deep learning


## Abstract

The aim of this research is to use deep learning for person re identification. Person re-identification is a process of matching images of same person by using different views of multiple non-overlapping camera views.  In this research we will precede the process of person re-identification by using deep learning. And in deep learning we will use Backbone resnet. It is a term used in DeepLab models/papers to refer to the feature extractor network. These feature extractor networks compute features from the input image and then these features are upsampled by a simple decoder module of DeepLab models to generate segmented masks. The goal of the individual re-identifying (re-ID) is to locate a subject of concern through several non-overlapping cameras. In recent years deep machine learning has been widely used for intelligent video detection, and person identification. But there is a very limited range of researches which explore the process of person re identification by using backbone resent. In this research we explore this process by utilizing a different data sets likes (cukh01, cukh02, cukh03 etc,).  Findings of the study explored that backbone resent gave 90 percent accurate and efficient response as compare to other neural networks. This study emphasis for the use of individual Re-ID in accessible-world setting, with more demanding challenges.
